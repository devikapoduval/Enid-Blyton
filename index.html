              Enid Blyton, in full Enid Mary Blyton, (born August 11, 1897, East Dulwich, London, England—died November 28, 1968, Hampstead, London), prolific and highly popular British author of stories, poems, plays, and educational books for children.Here are two of her book summary.
                <br>
                <br> 
                The first book explains Noddy's origins. He is made by a woodcarver in a toy store but runs away after the man begins to make a wooden lion, which scares Noddy. As he wanders through the woods naked, penniless, and homeless, he meets Big Ears, a friendly gnome.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Magic Faraway Tree follows siblings Joe, Beth, Frannie and their cousin Dick as they move to a new home and explore the nearby woods. They come across a tree with a small door at the bottom and discover a world of magical creatures, new friends and adventures along the way.
